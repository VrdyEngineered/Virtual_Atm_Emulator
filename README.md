# Bank Management System

This project is a secure and efficient internet banking system developed in Java, designed to provide net banking facilities to banking customers. The application uses **Java AWT** and **Swing** to create a user-friendly graphical interface, allowing users to perform essential banking operations securely. The backend is powered by **MySQL**, which stores user data and transaction information.

## About Java Swing

Java Swing is a part of the **Java Foundation Classes (JFC)**, which provides a set of GUI components and tools to develop rich user interfaces for Java applications. Swing is built on top of the **AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit)** and provides a more flexible and feature-rich alternative to AWT components.

In this project, **Java Swing** is used to create the graphical user interface (GUI). It allows users to interact with the system through various components such as buttons, text fields, and labels, ensuring a seamless banking experience. Swing components are platform-independent, meaning the application will look and behave the same across different operating systems.

   1. **Step 1:** Download the necessary JAR files (e.g., MySQL Connector/J, any additional libraries for Swing, etc.).
   2. **Step 2:** Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
   3. **Step 3:** Navigate to **File > Project Structure** or press **Ctrl + Alt + Shift + S**.
   4. **Step 4:** In the Project Structure window, select **Modules** from the left-hand pane.
   5. **Step 5:** Select the **Dependencies** tab on the right, then click the **+** icon to add a new dependency.
   6. **Step 6:** Choose **JARs or directories** and browse to the location where you downloaded the required JAR files. Select the JAR files and click **OK**.
   7. **Step 7:** The JAR files will now be added as dependencies in your project. Click **Apply** and then **OK** to save the changes.

6. **Run the Project:**
   - Run the Java application in IntelliJ. The GUI will launch, and you can interact with the banking system directly from the Swing-based interface.
